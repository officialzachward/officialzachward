**About Me**   
I am a senior Computer Science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2021 with a concentration in Systems & Software, and a minor in Economics. I am a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity as well as the Pi Mu Epsilon Math Honors Society and am passionate about learning new technologies; currently, I'm learning Vue! After I graduate, I will begin my career as a Full Stack Web Developer with NetApp where I am excited to grow as an engineer. In my free time, when I'm not coding, I love spending time with friends and family, going on hikes and exploring nature.
