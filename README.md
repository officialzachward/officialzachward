**About Me ðŸ“–**   
I am a full-stack software developer with a focus on web development. In particular, I utilize my skills to make customers' and users' lives easier through seamless user experience and scalable, reliable backends. For the past ~3 years, I have been putting these skills to use at NetApp, working on their Astra product's UI and backend.

Features I've worked on include and are not limited to:
* Highly Available Backend Services
* Immutable Backup Support
* Backend Optimizations
* Execution Hooks UI and Backend Events
* Various API Endpoints + Etag verification for preventing collisions
* Meshing of backend services via LinkerD
* Volume Provisioning UI
* UI for managing multiple clouds (GCP, AWS, Azure) in Astra
