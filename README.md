**Hi, I'm Zach! ðŸ‘‹**

**About Me ðŸ“–**   
I am a full-stack software developer with a focus on web development. In particular, I utilize my skills to make customers' and users' lives easier through seamless user experience and scalable, reliable backends. For the past ~2 years, I have been putting these skills to use at NetApp, working on their Astra product's UI and backend.

Features I've worked on include and are not limited to:
* Highly Available Backend Services
* Execution Hooks UI and Backend Events
* Various API Endpoints + Etag verification for preventing collisions
* Volume Provisioning UI
* UI for managing multiple clouds (GCP, AWS, Azure) in Astra

My current, ongoing problem is a learning management system, potentially to be used by universities if all goes well. Problems I'd be solving with this project are:
* Providing an easy to navigate platform, which is rare for the typical learning management system
* Providing a reliable, scalable backend, immune to most of the typical technical issues which many LMS' encounter
* Allowing for mobile optimization, so the LMS can be seamlessly accessed from a smartphone
* Supplying stellar communication resources so students can interact with each other and professors through the LMS
* Security: many LMS' are straight up insecure and do not protect the data of the students
